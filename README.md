## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the backend development using Node.js. It highlights key backend functionalities including the establishment of an API, addressing cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and applying the MVC architectural pattern for organized API deployment.

## Features

### Node.js and API Development
- **Introduction to Node.js**: Understanding the core concepts and modules of Node.js.
- **API Creation**: Step-by-step guide to building a robust API from the ground up.
- **CORS Solutions**: Implementing strategies to handle cross-origin requests effectively.
- **MVC Implementation**: Structuring the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to maintain a clean codebase.

### Database Connectivity and Security
- **MySQL Database Setup**: Incorporating a MySQL database to manage application data.
- **Security Measures**: Implementing security best practices to protect the database against potential threats.

## Repository Contents
- `controllers`, `models`, `routes`: Key components in the MVC architecture, handling logic, data representation, and routing respectively.
- `middlewares`: Functions designed to process requests before they reach the controllers.
- `schemas`: Definitions for the database schema, ensuring data integrity and structure.

Additional utilities include `api.http` for testing API endpoints and configuration files for various server setups (`localServer.js`, `mongodbServer.js`, `mysqlServer.js`).
